ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JeyaViknan
ğŸ‘€ Passionate about backend web development with a growing interest in machine learning. Hosting websites is both a thrill and a challengeâ€”exactly how I like it.
ğŸŒ± Currently pursuing a research internship at NIT Trichy, focusing on Large Language Models and their applications.
ğŸ”’ Most of my projects are privateâ€”for now. Letâ€™s just say they have patent-worthy potential ğŸ˜‰
